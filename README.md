## Overview

ProDrive IQ solves three real problems car owners face in Saudi Arabia:

- Hard to find trusted workshops without personal referrals
- No price transparency before visiting a workshop
- Booking requires phone calls or physical visits

The platform lets users browse verified workshops, filter by city and service type, book appointments online with full VAT pricing, and manage bookings from a personal dashboard.

## Features

- **Authentication** — register and login with credential validation, session stored in localStorage
- **Workshop filtering** — filter by city (Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, Al Khobar) and service type (Mechanical, Maintenance, Body & Paint, Electrical)
- **Booking flow** — select service, pick from dynamic date chips, choose time slot, enter vehicle details
- **Live VAT summary** — booking summary updates in real time with 15% VAT and total in SAR
- **Dashboard** — view upcoming bookings and past service history, sidebar navigation
- **Auth guard** — attempting to book without logging in redirects to login, then restores the booking after authentication

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — semantic structure (`nav`, `main`, `section`, `aside`, `footer`)
- **CSS3** — custom `style.css` with reusable helper classes (`.btn-primary`, `.card`, `.page-input`, `.nav-link`)
- **Tailwind CSS** — via CDN for layout and spacing utilities
- **JavaScript (ES5)** — single shared `script.js` for all pages
- **localStorage** — stores users, sessions, and bookings (no backend required)
